Welcome to my blog! I'm using this to track projects I work on, fixes I find, and general cool stuff. I hope you find something helpful here.
</p>

I'm a system administrator early in my career, looking to continuing my education while having fun learning. I'm interested in computer security, cyber threat intelligence, and general systems administration.

I'm also interested in learning programming more in depth, as well as getting into devops. It seems to be the future and I don't want to be left behind. Stay with me for more fun stuff!
